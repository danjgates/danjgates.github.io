Welcome to my site in progress. Here you can find information about me and some of the science and research I have been engaged in as well as blog posts about technical aspects of genomics, bioinformatics, and data science that interest me.


Current and future plans for this site
======
1. Check out the blog page for a multipart guide on how I approach running pipelines in the cloud (in progress)
1. Watch for future blog posts about creation and cloud deployment of dashboards with Python Dash and AWS EBS and possibly a short blog on tools for designer protein hallucination


Visit the publications tab for some highlights of projects I've been worked on in the past

For more info about this page:
This was built from a fork of academicpages. For more info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
